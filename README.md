# Voster Coaster VR

Voster Coaster is an experimental VR (Room Scale) roller coaster builder and theme park tycoon game.

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE0_oyK1Juo), you can place roller coasters, food stands, and other attractions along the ground, and watch them all. You will have to manage the park to keep having enough money to keep expanding.

I also plan to add the ability to go down to human scale, or even ride roller coasters in first person.
