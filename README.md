# Voster Coaster VR

Voster Coaster is an experimental VR (Room Scale) roller coaster builder and theme park tycoon game.

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE0_oyK1Juo), you can place roller coasters, food stands, and other attractions along the ground, and watch them all. You will have to manage the park to keep having enough money to keep expanding.

I also plan to add the ability to go down to human scale, or even ride roller coasters in first person.

# Current Status

Currently, you can build a roller coaster by placing splines and pointing in the direction you want to go. Only roller coaster building is implemented so far.

The latest code is pushed to [the experimental branch](https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoasterVR/tree/experimental), this most recent build in that branch might not be working at all, the latest stable version will be in the master branch. After each new stable release, the changes will be merged to the master branch.
